"""Application Service: orchestrates one install invocation.

The ``InstallService`` is the *behaviour-bearing* entry point for installs.
Adapters (the Click handler today; programmatic / API callers tomorrow)
build an :class:`InstallRequest` and call :meth:`InstallService.run`,
which returns a :class:`InstallResult`.  Adapters own presentation,
``sys.exit``, and CLI option parsing -- the service does not.

Why a class rather than a free function?
----------------------------------------
The class encapsulates the *seam* for future dependency injection.  Today
the underlying ``run_install_pipeline`` builds collaborators internally;
when (and only when) a programmatic caller needs to swap the downloader
or integrator factories, the service can grow constructor parameters
without changing every call site.

For now the service is intentionally lean: it validates that the dep
system is available, then delegates to the existing pipeline.  This
gives every adapter a typed Request -> Result contract today without
the blast radius of a deeper DI rewrite.
