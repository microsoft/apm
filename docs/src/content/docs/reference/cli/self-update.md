Update a standalone APM CLI installation to the latest GitHub release.

## Synopsis

```bash
apm self-update [--check]
```

## Description

Use `apm self-update` for **standalone installs**. It downloads and runs the official
platform installer (`install.sh` on macOS/Linux, `install.ps1` on Windows).

:::note[Homebrew core]
The Homebrew core formula disables self-update, including `--check`, and startup
update notices. `apm self-update` prints a message directing you to
`brew upgrade apm` and exits without running the installer. For pip, Scoop, or
other package-manager installs, use the owning manager's upgrade command.
:::

:::caution[Looking for dependency updates?]
This command does **not** update the packages declared in your `apm.yml`. To re-resolve your dependencies against the latest matching versions or Git refs, run:

```bash
apm update
```

See [`apm update`](../update/) for the dependency refresh workflow, or [`apm install --frozen`](../install/) for a read-only, lockfile-pinned install.
:::

The command compares the installed version against the latest GitHub release and exits early if you are already current. With `--check`, it reports availability without installing.

Self-update can read two non-secret installer preferences from `apm config`:

- `self-update.channel`: `stable` (default) selects the newest stable release; `prerelease` selects the newest non-draft prerelease.
- `self-update.install-dir`: launcher directory passed as `APM_INSTALL_DIR`. On Unix, it is a preservation preference: it must match the existing launcher, while unset preserves the detected installation. Windows behavior is unchanged.

`APM_SELF_UPDATE_CHANNEL` and `APM_INSTALL_DIR` override config. An explicit `VERSION` pins the release. Otherwise, either channel passes its selected release to the installer as one normalized `v<version>` value.

Credentials, registry tokens, mirror URLs, commands, and installer arguments are **not** persisted in self-update config. Tokens still resolve through the existing auth path; enterprise mirror URLs remain environment variables.

## Enterprise bootstrap mirrors

`apm self-update` uses the same mirror contract as the installer scripts. See the [installation bootstrap mirror section](../../../getting-started/installation/#enterprise-bootstrap-mirror-mode) for the canonical setup. When `APM_INSTALLER_BASE_URL` is set, it stays authoritative and APM appends only the platform script name. Otherwise, a resolved release uses its exact `v<version>` ref on GitHub or GHES; the `aka.ms` or current-ref fallback is used only when no release has been resolved.

Unix self-update inherits [archive verification](../../../getting-started/installation/#unix-archive-verification) only when the selected release-tag or mirrored installer includes the guard. SHA-256 sidecars check same-publisher integrity; they are not independent provenance or signing. Older tagged scripts do not gain verification retroactively.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `APM_RELEASE_METADATA_URL` | _(unset)_ | Exact URL for mirrored release metadata, usually a static `latest.json` with at least `{"tag_name":"vX.Y.Z"}`. Overrides GitHub release metadata lookup. |
| `APM_INSTALLER_BASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | Authoritative base URL containing `install.sh` and `install.ps1`. APM appends only the platform script name, not a GitHub release ref. |
| `APM_RELEASE_BASE_URL` | _(unset)_ | Base URL containing release archives and their SHA-256 `.sha256` sidecars at `{base}/{tag}/{asset}`. Used by the selected installer. |
| `APM_PYPI_INDEX_URL` | _(unset)_ | PyPI-compatible index used by installer pip fallback. |
| `APM_NO_DIRECT_FALLBACK` | _(unset)_ | Set to `1` to fail closed instead of using public GitHub, `aka.ms`, or PyPI fallback. |
| `APM_SELF_UPDATE_CHANNEL` | `stable` | Invocation-scoped channel override: `stable` or `prerelease`. Overrides `apm config set self-update.channel ...`. |
| `APM_INSTALL_DIR` | preserve detected Unix installation / Windows installer default | Overrides `self-update.install-dir`. On Unix it must match the existing launcher directory and cannot redirect the installation. |
| `GITHUB_URL` | `https://github.com` | Legacy GitHub/GHES base URL. When the installer mirror is unset, a resolved release downloads the raw script from this host at its exact tag. |
| `APM_REPO` | `microsoft/apm` | Repository in `owner/repo` form for GitHub/GHES metadata and raw installer paths. |
| `VERSION` | _(unset)_ | Pin a release tag and skip release metadata lookup. |

Example:

```bash
export APM_RELEASE_METADATA_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/generic/apm-releases/latest.json"
export APM_INSTALLER_BASE_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/generic/apm-install"
export APM_RELEASE_BASE_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/generic/apm-releases"
export APM_PYPI_INDEX_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/api/pypi/python-proxy/simple"
export APM_NO_DIRECT_FALLBACK=1

apm self-update --check
apm self-update
```

With `APM_NO_DIRECT_FALLBACK=1`, missing or unreachable mirror settings are hard failures with a non-zero exit. For the full fail-closed scope, GHES token boundary, and no-egress smoke recipe, see [Enterprise bootstrap mirror mode](../../../getting-started/installation/#enterprise-bootstrap-mirror-mode).

## Options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--check` | Only check whether a newer release exists. Print the result and exit without installing. |

## Examples

Check for an available update:

```bash
apm self-update --check
```

Install the latest release:

```bash
apm self-update
```

Persist a release channel:

```bash
apm config set self-update.channel prerelease
apm self-update
apm config unset self-update.channel
```

## Behavior

When an update is available, APM downloads and runs the platform installer, streaming its output. On Unix, Python passes the running executable's identity and destination preferences without independently resolving destinations; `install.sh` remains the destination and ownership authority. Self-update preserves the existing launcher, bundle, and native shell setup receipt; it never enrolls another shell or edits profiles/hooks. Neither layer invokes `sudo`.

## Where the new binary lands

Recognized Unix bundles retain their launcher/bundle directories whether `self-update.install-dir` is set to the matching launcher directory or left unset. Conflicting overrides fail; this setting does not migrate an installation. See [ownership and migration](../../../getting-started/installation/#unix-install-ownership-and-migration) for bundle recognition, permission checks, administrator updates, and pip fallback restrictions.

On Windows, self-update advances the [stable executable path](../../../getting-started/installation/). Configuration under `~/.apm/` and project files are untouched.

## After update

On Unix, follow the installer's final output. If the launcher is off `PATH`, run the exact shell-specific `PATH` command it prints or continue using the absolute launcher path.

On Windows, restart your terminal or run `apm --version` to verify the update.

## Rollback

APM does not keep previous binaries. Reinstall with a [version pin](../../../getting-started/installation/#installer-options), retaining the original Unix destinations. For package-managed installs, use the original package manager.

## Failure modes

Release metadata failures exit `1`, including with `--check`: authentication (refresh credentials), rate limits (wait), HTTP/network errors (check endpoint/connectivity), or malformed JSON/metadata (verify source). Malformed `GITHUB_URL` produces a sanitized configuration diagnostic: use a valid HTTPS URL. HTTP 3xx reports that redirects are not followed, without echoing `Location`; see [mirror migration](../../../getting-started/installation/#enterprise-bootstrap-mirror-mode). See [Public release metadata](../../../getting-started/installation/#public-release-metadata) for retry restrictions.

Download failures or non-zero installer exits also return `1` with mirror or manual update guidance. Unix ownership/destination refusals leave the existing installation untouched; follow the reported administrator/package-manager update action.

## Startup update notification

APM checks for new releases at most once per day during normal command execution. When a newer version is available, you see:

```
A new version of APM is available: 0.7.0 (current: 0.6.3)
Run apm self-update to upgrade
```

The check is cached and non-blocking. Lookup, network, and metadata failures stay quiet. It is suppressed in distributions that disable self-update.
